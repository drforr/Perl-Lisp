Perl-Lisp version 0.0.1

Something of a wacky notion of mine, based on the notion of language
equivalence. Both perl and Lisp are Turing-complete, therefore it should be
possible to transform one into the other. Right? In fact there's a small subset
that works almost mechanically, and that's what this is, a mechanical translator
from one language to another.

Of course, it won't work for the whole of both languages, but if I can isolate
a small-enough subset it'd work. And fellow hackers might learn something about
Lisp in the meantime.
